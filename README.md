# just-a-script-like-archinstall
I made a script that works for me, I'll update it a little later, I posted it only because I'm just starting to edit it, then I'll copy it from the GitHub repository to a virtual machine and try it out, you don't need anything except a password and nickname, use it if necessary, it's for SDA drives and 230 GB of partition memory.
